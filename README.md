# reactjs
Repo holds examples and templates to start React js 

This repo will be updated as I progress, and this repo is for people like me, who finds reactjs harder to understand.

I will try to update the repo with as much example as I could, as I progress on.

index.html is the default starter template
script.js holds code for a node static server.

Clone this repo, install node static : npm install node-static (node and npm should be pre-installed)
To run : node server.js
